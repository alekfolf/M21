# M21
A multiplatform, open source music player and library organizer for Windows 10/10X and Android made for the 2020s decade.

M21 is a local music player made for Desktop and Mobile that lets you take control of your content and lets you organize, edit metadata or just simply play your music files no matter the format (MP3, FLAC, M4A, WAV, AAC)

This project is still in very early development but if you're interested be ready to see some advances in the design and planning in the near future.
